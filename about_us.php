               The business started as a side project for Arina in 2003, when she joined her love for fashion and took a job at a local store in Bukit Bintang district as a sales associate. Soon she was working with the very talented business manager and made a name for herself on the floor. The manager shared her passion with Arina, and so the two began a partnership.
